# Project Proposal - Are Other Movies Better or Worse Than Your Favorite Movie?

#### Question/need:
* My goal in this project is to use movie data such as budget, length, revenue, MPAA rating (etc.) to determine whether all movies are classified as better or worse than a user input movie. User ratings are subjective, so often we need to 'calibrate' a ranking system with a known movie and then we can use that as the baseline for classification.


#### Data Description:
* I will be using Data from IMDB and possibly grouplens.org to complile all the movie features into one dataset.
* Features that I will be gathering include budget, length, revenue, MPAA rating, user rating, (etc.)


#### Tools:
* This information is being accessed using online datasets with data manipulation/feature engineering using Pandas.

#### MVP Goal:
* A minimum viable product will be classifying movies into better or worse than a user input rating.
