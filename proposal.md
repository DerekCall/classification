# Project Proposal - NBA ALL-NBA Selection Classification

#### Question/need:
* I will be using historical NBA player data to classify which players will be selected to an ALL-NBA each year. This is important for teams to predict as player bonuses and supermax contracts hinge on having been selected to one of the ALL-NBA teams.


#### Data Description:
* I will be using NBA data that was gathered using an API from RapidAPI.
* I have gathered over 20 statistical categories for every player in NBA history. There are over 1 million individual data points.


#### Tools:
* I will use Python to continue with data exploration as well as modeling.

#### MVP Goal:
* A minimum viable product will be classifying ALL-NBA level players based on a season of work.
