# Project Proposal - NBA MVP Classification

#### Question/need:
* I will be using historical NBA player data to classify who will be the league MVP. This is important for teams to predict as player bonuses and supermax contracts hinge on winning/having won this award.


#### Data Description:
* I will be using NBA data that was gathered using an API from RapidAPI.
* I have gathered over 20 statistical categories for every player in NBA history. There are over 1 million individual data points.


#### Tools:
* I will use pandas to continue with data exploration as well as modeling.

#### MVP Goal:
* A minimum viable product will be classifying an MVP based on a season of work.
